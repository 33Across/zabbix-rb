I threw this together this afternoon. It's absulotely untested. I only just 
corrected a few syntax errors. 

== usage 

=== easy

  Zabbix::Sender::Easy.run(:"com.yammer.cron.brithday_email_job") do |zbx|
    Users.each_with_index do |user, idx|
      HappyBirthday.send if user.birthday?
  
      ## let zabbix know we're alive every N users, whatever
      zbx.send_heartbeat if idx % N == 0
    end
  end

=== tedious

  zbx = Zabbix::Sender.new
  zbx.send_start(:"com.yammer.cron.birthday_email_job")
  
  Users.each_with_index do |user, idx|
    HappyBirthday.send if user.birthday? 
  
    ## let zabbix know we're alive every N users, whatever 
    zbx.send_heartbeat if idx % N == 0
  end
  zbx.send_stop(:"com.yammer.cron.birthday_email_job")

=== other

  zbx = Zabbix::Sender.new(config_file: nil) # uses the default config file on the system

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

== Development notes

* Updated to require 2.3.8+ (currently supported branch minus one)

=== Dependencies

* Requires jeweler (tested with 2.1.2) ... once that's installed, the `check_dependencies` rake task will prompt for others

=== Test configuration

* edit `test/zabbix_agentd.conf` and set `Server=` to your actual server if you want the tests to pass

=== Known issues

* does not notify for Successful submissions that are Failed by the server

```{"response":"success","info":"processed: 0; failed: 1; total: 1; seconds spent: 0.000019"}```

* config reads lots of things, but doesn't expose or utilize them (bind IP, etc.)

* tests are local environment specific

* CI stuff is local-installation dependent.
